- Infrastructure capacity constraints
- Margin pressure from compute costs

### Private Market Risks
- Valuation volatility
- Liquidity constraints
- Technology risk (unproven at scale)
- Funding dependency
- Competitive dynamics with well-funded rivals

---

## 6. CONCLUSION

The analysis demonstrates a clear growth advantage for private pure-play AI investments:

1. **Growth Differential:** Private AI companies project 35-45% CAGR vs 15-20% for public AI segments
2. **Pure Exposure:** Private markets offer undiluted AI exposure vs ~37% attribution in public markets
3. **Innovation Alpha:** Private companies lead in AI innovation and capture more value
4. **Sector Allocation:** Efficient pure-play AI allocation only achievable through private markets

**Investment Thesis:** While public markets offer AI exposure through established tech giants, the inability to isolate AI returns combined with slower growth rates creates a compelling case for private market allocation. The 2-3x growth rate differential suggests private AI investments could significantly outperform public market AI exposure over the 2025-2030 period.

## ADDENDUM: Bottom-Up Calculation Methodology for 2030 Projections

### Purpose
This addendum documents the detailed bottom-up calculations used to derive the 2030 AI value projections displayed in the AI bubble chart visualization, providing an audit trail for the methodology and assumptions.

### Public Companies - Bottom-Up Calculation

#### Individual Company Projections (2025 → 2030)

**NVIDIA**
- 2025 AI-Attributable Value: $3,766B (88% of $4,280B market cap)

- Growth Rate Applied: 25% CAGR (conservative end of 25-30% range)
- 2030 Projection: $1,500B
- Rationale: AWS Bedrock and AI services scaling rapidly

**Meta**

- Growth Rate Applied: 20% CAGR (conservative end of 20-25% range)
- 2030 Projection: $1,600B
- Rationale: Llama ecosystem and AI-driven advertising growth

**All Others** (Combined smaller public companies)
- 2025 AI-Attributable Value: ~$2,066B
- Growth Rate Applied: 15% CAGR (mature company average)
- 2030 Projection: ~$4,100B
- Rationale: Established companies with AI initiatives but not core focus

**Total Public AI Value**
- 2025: $8,260B
- 2030: $20,900B
- **Implied Weighted CAGR: 19.2%**

### Private Companies - Bottom-Up Calculation

#### Individual Company Projections (2025 → 2030)

**OpenAI**
- 2025 Valuation: $400B
- Growth Rate Applied: 34% CAGR
- 2030 Projection: $1,750B (midpoint of $1.5-2T range)
- Rationale: Revenue growing 65-75% but valuation growth more moderate due to high starting point

**Anthropic**
- 2025 Valuation: $170B
- Growth Rate Applied: 29% CAGR
- 2030 Projection: $600B (midpoint of $500-700B range)
- Rationale: Exceptional revenue growth (80-90%) but from smaller base, conservative valuation multiple

**Databricks**
- 2025 Valuation: $100B
- Growth Rate Applied: 28% CAGR
- 2030 Projection: $350B (midpoint of $300-400B range)
- Rationale: Strong enterprise adoption, IPO catalyst, 40-50% revenue CAGR

**All Other Private Companies**
- 2025 Combined Valuation: $140B
- Breakdown:
  - SSI: $32B → $150B (37% CAGR - speculative AGI play)
  - Perplexity: $20B → $65B (27% CAGR - midpoint of $50-80B range)
  - Midjourney: $10B → $50B (38% CAGR - midpoint of $40-60B range)
  - Cohere: $6.8B → $28B (33% CAGR - enterprise LLM growth)
  - Mistral: $6.5B → $26B (32% CAGR - European champion)
  - Others: ~$65B → $281B (34% CAGR - weighted average)
- 2030 Total for Others: $600B

**Total Private AI Value**
- 2025: $810B
- 2030: $3,300B
- **Implied Weighted CAGR: 32.4%**

### Key Assumptions

1. **Conservative Bias**: We generally used the lower to middle range of projected CAGRs to avoid overly optimistic projections

2. **Valuation vs Revenue Growth**: Private company valuations typically grow slower than revenue due to multiple compression as companies mature

3. **Market Share Dynamics**: Assumed no major disruption to current market leaders, though this is a significant risk

4. **Concentration Risk**: The projections heavily depend on OpenAI and Anthropic execution (70% of private value)

5. **Public Attribution Stability**: Assumed AI attribution percentages remain relatively stable for public companies

### Validation Check

The bottom-up approach yields:
- Public: 19.2% CAGR (vs. 17.5% top-down estimate)
- Private: 32.4% CAGR (vs. 35% top-down estimate)

The slight differences validate that our bottom-up calculations are reasonable and actually more conservative than simple CAGR applications, providing additional credibility to the projections.

### Usage Note

These projections are used in the AI bubble chart visualization to show the comparative growth trajectories of public AI-attributable value versus private pure-play AI companies, demonstrating the superior growth dynamics and concentration of value creation in private markets.
