# QA Validation Plan for EQUIAM LinkedIn Bubble Charts
**Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Sectors:** AI, Space Tech, Robotics & Automation, Defense Tech, Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity

## Executive Summary
This document outlines a comprehensive Quality Assurance plan for validating sector bubble charts used in EQUIAM's LinkedIn content. The plan ensures accuracy, completeness, and defensibility of all data points, valuations, and growth projections.

## 1. SECTOR COMPOSITION VALIDATION

### 1.1 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
For each sector, validate:
- **Glaring Omissions**: Companies that sector experts would expect to see
- **Questionable Inclusions**: Companies that don't primarily operate in the sector
- **Edge Cases**: Companies with partial sector exposure requiring allocation analysis

### 1.2 Company Classification Framework
| Criteria | Threshold | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Primary Revenue from Sector | >50% | Include at 100% |
| Significant Revenue from Sector | 20-50% | Include at weighted % |
| Minor Revenue from Sector | <20% | Exclude or note separately |
| Pure-Play Companies | 80%+ | Priority inclusion |
| Conglomerates | Varies | Require allocation analysis |

### 1.3 Sector-Specific Review Points

#### AI Sector
- Focus on companies with core AI/ML products or services
- Exclude companies merely using AI as a tool
- Include infrastructure providers (chips, cloud) with allocation

#### Space Technology
- Commercial space operations vs. traditional aerospace
- Satellite operators vs. manufacturers
- Launch providers vs. payload companies

#### Robotics & Automation
- Industrial vs. consumer robotics
- Autonomous vehicles as subset
- Software vs. hardware focus

#### Defense Technology
- Modern defense tech vs. traditional contractors
- Dual-use technology companies
- Export control considerations

#### Quantum Computing
- Hardware vs. software companies
- Research stage vs. commercial products
- Classical computing companies with quantum divisions

#### Cybersecurity
- Pure-play security vs. broader IT companies
- Product vs. services companies
- Cloud security vs. traditional security

## 2. VALUATION VERIFICATION FRAMEWORK

### 2.1 Data Sources Hierarchy
1. **Primary Sources** (Most Reliable)
   - SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)
   - Official company investor relations pages
   - Exchange data (NYSE, NASDAQ)

2. **Secondary Sources** (Reliable)
   - Bloomberg Terminal
   - Reuters/Refinitiv
   - S&P Capital IQ
   - PitchBook

3. **Tertiary Sources** (Use with Caution)
   - TechCrunch/Crunchbase
   - News articles
   - Industry reports

### 2.2 Validation Requirements
- **Public Companies**: Market cap as of August 29, 2025 (close of market)
- **Private Companies**: Most recent funding round valuation
- **Date Cutoff**: Valuations must be from 2024-2025
- **Currency**: All values in USD billions

### 2.3 CSV Data Structure
Each sector CSV will contain:
```csv
company_name,ticker,type,valuation_billions,valuation_date,source,confidence_level,sector_allocation_pct,notes
```

## 3. REVENUE ALLOCATION ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Bottoms-Up Framework for Public Companies
For each public company, determine:
1. **Total Revenue** (latest fiscal year)
2. **Segment Breakdown** (from 10-K segment reporting)
3. **Sector-Attributable Revenue** (calculated)
4. **Allocation Percentage** (sector revenue / total revenue)
5. **Adjusted Market Cap** (market cap Ã— allocation %)

### 3.2 Data Collection Template
| Company | Total Rev | Sector Rev | Allocation % | Market Cap | Adjusted Cap |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Example | $100B | $25B | 25% | $500B | $125B |

### 3.3 Special Considerations
- **Microsoft**: Separate Azure AI, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI investment
- **Google**: Separate Cloud AI, DeepMind, Waymo
- **Amazon**: AWS AI services, Robotics division
- **Meta**: AI research, Reality Labs

## 4. GROWTH RATE PROJECTIONS

### 4.1 5-Year CAGR Methodology

#### Public Companies
1. **Historical Analysis**: 3-5 year historical CAGR
2. **Analyst Consensus**: Average of major bank projections
3. **Industry Reports**: Gartner, IDC, McKinsey sector forecasts
4. **Weighted Average**: Combine sources with confidence weights

#### Private Companies
1. **Funding Growth**: Valuation growth between rounds
2. **Revenue Multiple**: Based on comparable public companies
3. **Industry Benchmarks**: Top quartile growth rates
4. **Technology Maturity**: Adjust for S-curve adoption

### 4.2 CAGR Validation Framework
| Growth Rate | Classification | Validation Required |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| >100% | Hyper-growth | Multiple sources + justification |
| 50-100% | High growth | 2+ corroborating sources |
| 25-50% | Moderate-high | Industry average comparison |
| 10-25% | Moderate | Standard validation |
| <10% | Low/Mature | Explain if surprising |

### 4.3 Expected CAGR Ranges by Sector
- **AI**: Public 15-25%, Private 50-150%
- **Space Tech**: Public 5-10%, Private 30-60%
- **Robotics**: Public 10-20%, Private 40-80%
- **Defense Tech**: Public 3-8%, Private 60-120%
- **Quantum**: Public 20-40%, Private 80-200%
- **Cybersecurity**: Public 10-15%, Private 30-60%

## 5. QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKLIST

### 5.1 Pre-Publication Checklist
- [ ] All market caps verified within 48 hours
- [ ] Private valuations from rounds within 12 months
- [ ] Revenue allocations documented for multi-sector companies
- [ ] Growth rates supported by 2+ sources
- [ ] Total addressable market (TAM) validated
