## ROBOTICS SECTOR

### Analysis Framework
For the robotics sector, we define "robotics" broadly to include:
1. Companies that manufacture robots (industrial, surgical, service)
2. Companies that provide critical enabling technologies (vision systems, sensors, control software)
3. Companies that provide automation systems and software for robotic operations
4. Companies that manufacture precision components specifically for robots

Most companies in this sector are pure-play or near pure-play robotics companies, making attribution analysis straightforward.
