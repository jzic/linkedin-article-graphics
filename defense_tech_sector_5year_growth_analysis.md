- Dual-use technology restrictions
- Valuation volatility (Anduril: $14B→$30B in one year)
- Competition for talent with tech giants

---

## 7. CONCLUSION

The analysis reveals a dramatic growth differential between public and private defense investments:

1. **Growth Differential:** Private defense tech companies project 35-50% CAGR vs 8-12% for public defense segments
2. **Innovation Leadership:** Private companies pioneering AI warfare, autonomous systems, and space defense
3. **Pure Exposure:** Private markets offer 100% defense exposure vs ~62% attribution in public markets
4. **Value Creation:** Private defense tech market projected to grow 6x by 2030 vs 1.6x for public

**Investment Thesis:** The defense sector is undergoing its most significant transformation since the jet age, driven by great power competition, technological disruption, and the Ukraine war's lessons. While traditional primes offer stability and scale, they're constrained by legacy systems, cost-plus contracts, and innovation inertia. Private defense tech companies are revolutionizing warfare with AI, autonomy, and software—capturing outsized value through 3-4x faster growth rates.

The combination of pure-play exposure (100% vs 62%), technological superiority, and explosive growth rates (35-50% vs 8-12% CAGR) makes private defense tech investments the superior vehicle for capturing the sector's transformation. With global defense spending approaching $3T and NATO committing to 5% GDP by 2035, the runway for growth extends well beyond 2030.
