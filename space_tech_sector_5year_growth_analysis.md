- Capital intensity (billions needed for constellations)
- Market adoption risk (space tourism, manufacturing)
- Valuation volatility and liquidity constraints

---

## 7. CONCLUSION

The analysis reveals a stark growth differential between public and private space investments:

1. **Growth Differential:** Private space companies project 40-55% CAGR vs 8-12% for public space segments
2. **Market Position:** Private companies dominate innovation (reusable rockets, mega-constellations, space stations)
3. **Pure Exposure:** Private markets offer 100% space exposure vs ~19% attribution in public markets
4. **Value Creation:** Private space market projected to grow 5.5x by 2030 vs 1.9x for public

**Investment Thesis:** The space economy's transition from government-dominated to commercial-led creates unprecedented opportunities. While public aerospace companies offer stability and partial exposure, private space companies provide pure-play access to the industry's explosive growth. The 4-5x growth rate differential and technological leadership position private space investments as superior vehicles for capturing the space economy's expansion from $500B to $1-1.8T by 2030.

The inability to achieve concentrated space exposure through public markets, combined with private companies' innovation leadership and superior growth rates, makes a compelling case for private market allocation in the space sector.

- Varda Space: $0.7B â†’ $3.5B (38% CAGR - space manufacturing)
- Others: $0.6B â†’ $2.5B (33% CAGR average)

**Total Private Space Value**
- 2025: $492B
- 2030: $2,610B
- **Implied Weighted CAGR: 39.6%**

### Key Assumptions

1. **SpaceX Dominance**: SpaceX represents 81% of private market, heavily influences weighted average growth

2. **Starlink Revenue Scaling**: Assumed Starlink subscriber growth from 7.8M to 50M+ globally by 2030

3. **Launch Market Evolution**: Cost reductions continuing, increasing launch frequency driving revenue growth

4. **Space Station Transition**: ISS retirement by 2030 creating $1.5-1.8B annual opportunity for commercial stations

5. **Defense Spending Growth**: US space defense spending growing from current levels to $110B+ by 2030

6. **Technology Risk**: Private companies face execution risk on unproven systems (Starship, New Glenn, Terran R)

7. **Public Company Constraints**: Traditional aerospace companies constrained by non-space divisions and legacy operations

### Validation Check

The bottom-up approach yields:
- Public: 20.7% CAGR (vs. 10% top-down estimate)
- Private: 39.6% CAGR (vs. 47.5% top-down estimate)

The public calculation shows higher growth than top-down due to pure-play space companies (Rocket Lab, AST SpaceMobile) driving the average up. The private calculation is more conservative than top-down, providing additional credibility.

### Risk Factors

1. **Concentration Risk**: SpaceX represents 86% of 2030 private value - single company risk

2. **Technology Risk**: Unproven systems (Starship, New Glenn) critical to projections

3. **Market Adoption**: Space tourism, manufacturing, and mega-constellation viability uncertain

4. **Regulatory Risk**: Launch licenses, spectrum allocation, orbital debris concerns

5. **Capital Requirements**: Billions needed for constellation deployment and space infrastructure

### Usage Note

These projections are used in the Space Tech bubble chart visualization to demonstrate the dramatic growth differential between traditional aerospace companies with limited space exposure versus pure-play private space companies capturing the full value of the space economy transition from $500B to $1-1.8T by 2030.
