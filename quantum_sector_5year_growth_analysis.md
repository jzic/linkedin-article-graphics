## 7. CONCLUSION

The analysis reveals a significant growth differential between public and private quantum investments:

1. **Growth Differential:** Private quantum companies project 40-60% CAGR vs 25-35% for public quantum segments
2. **Exposure Challenge:** Public markets offer only 0.35% quantum exposure on average
3. **Innovation Leadership:** Private companies pioneering breakthrough approaches (photonic, neutral atom)
4. **Market Creation:** Private companies driving from $1.6B to $150B+ market by 2030

**Investment Thesis:** The quantum computing sector represents one of the most asymmetric opportunities in technology, with potential to revolutionize computing across industries. While tech giants offer quantum exposure, the extreme dilution (0.35% attribution) and mixed priorities severely limit investment returns. Private quantum companies offer pure-play exposure to this revolution, with 2x faster growth rates and technical leadership in next-generation approaches.

The combination of pure exposure (100% vs 0.35%), superior growth (40-60% vs 25-35% CAGR), and breakthrough innovation positions private quantum investments as the optimal vehicle for capturing value in the transition from classical to quantum computing. With the market projected to add $1T+ to the global economy by 2035, early private market positioning offers exceptional upside potential.

### Conclusion

The bottom-up analysis validates our thesis that private quantum companies offer superior growth potential (51.4% vs 37.8% CAGR) while providing pure-play exposure to the quantum computing revolution. The extreme dilution in public markets (0.35% attribution average) makes private markets the only viable path for meaningful quantum exposure.

The $326.5B total addressable quantum market by 2030 represents a 6x expansion from today's $55.8B, with private companies maintaining significant market share through technological leadership in photonic, neutral atom, and next-generation quantum approaches.

The concentration risk in both markets reflects the winner-take-most dynamics of quantum computing, where companies achieving fault-tolerant quantum advantage first will capture outsized value creation in the transition to the quantum computing era.
