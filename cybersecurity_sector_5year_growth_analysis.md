## 7. CONCLUSION

The analysis reveals a significant growth differential between public and private cybersecurity investments:

1. **Growth Differential:** Private cybersecurity companies project 25-35% CAGR vs 12-18% for public cyber segments
2. **Market Position:** Private companies leading innovation in SASE, AI security, and Zero Trust
3. **Pure Exposure:** Private markets offer 100% cybersecurity exposure vs ~26% attribution in public markets
4. **Value Creation:** Private cyber market projected to grow 3.9x by 2030 vs 2x for public

**Investment Thesis:** The cybersecurity sector is experiencing unprecedented growth driven by escalating threats, digital transformation, and regulatory requirements. While public cybersecurity leaders offer stability and scale, they're constrained by slower growth rates and, for diversified companies, minimal cyber exposure (26% average). Private cybersecurity companies offer pure-play exposure to the sector's explosive growth, with innovation leadership in emerging categories like SASE, enterprise browsers, and AI security.

The combination of pure exposure (100% vs 26%), superior growth rates (25-35% vs 12-18% CAGR), and technological innovation positions private cybersecurity investments as the optimal vehicle for capturing value in the transition to a $500B+ market by 2030. With the TAM potentially reaching $2T and continuous threat evolution ensuring sustained demand, the sector offers exceptional long-term growth potential.

### Conclusion

The bottom-up analysis validates our thesis that private cybersecurity companies offer superior growth potential (34.3% vs 14.5% CAGR) while providing pure-play exposure to the sector's transformation. The significant dilution in public markets (26% attribution average) makes private markets essential for meaningful cybersecurity exposure.

The $1.34T total addressable cybersecurity market by 2030 represents a 2.2x expansion from today's $608.6B, with private companies nearly doubling their market share through innovation leadership in SASE, AI security, and cloud-native platforms.

The concentration risk in both markets reflects the winner-take-most dynamics of cybersecurity, where platform companies with the broadest security capabilities and deepest AI integration will capture outsized value creation as organizations consolidate their security vendors.
